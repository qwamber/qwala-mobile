# Qwa.la Mobile

The Qwa.la Mobile app makes it easy to shorten links on the go. The mobile app
is written in React Native, with support for both iOS and Android. The app
utilizes the https://mobile.qwa.la subdomain for the app interface.

## Development

To download and run the React Native application, begin by cloning the
repository. Once you have the source code, calling

```bash
npm install
react-native run-ios
```

should run the iOS application on a simulator on your computer.
